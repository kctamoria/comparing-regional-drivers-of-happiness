# Comparing Social and Economic Drivers of Happiness in Asian vs. Non-Asian Countries

This EDA project examines how factors influencing national happiness scores vary between Asian and non-Asian countries, utilizing data from the World Happiness Report (2015-2018) and educational attainment statistics from the World Bank Group. 

Cleaned and merged > 800 global records to analyze the impacts of GDP per capita, freedom, and generosity on national happiness. Analyzed global happiness trends using Python (pandas, seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib), created visualizations (heatmaps, scatterplots, choropleth maps) to communicate cultural distinctions, conducted regression analysis (statsmodels) to compare regional differences in economic and social predictors, identifying unique cultural drivers of happiness between Asian and Non-Asian countries.

This served as a final group project in COGS 108.
